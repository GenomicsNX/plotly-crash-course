# Plotly Crash Course

This course was designed to help you get started using Plotly. If you ever felt like your data visualization skills could use an upgrade from the same old spreadsheets, look no further. Plotly is able to deliver very cool charts with little effort.

There are two notebooks in this folder. One has all the code, and the other has just the headers in case you want to use it to code along with the videos.

The full course is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCoI9Wo2dbNI_3-rXb5GJhg).


## What you will need

You just need to have Python installed and a way to run Jupyter Notebooks. I recommend installing the Anaconda distribution if you are new to Python. It’s super easy to install and configure, and there are plenty of tutorials you can use to help you.

Might be useful to know a thing or two about data manipulation with the *pandas* package, but the coding is really basic throughout the whole course.

## How to follow along

I recommend taking your time with each chart, and really explore the options Plotly gives you for each one. I try to teach you how to look for the stuff you need in the documentation, so I hope you find it useful if you decide to explore Plotly further. It was for me when I was starting out!
